# Some scripts to setup a lab environment in Azure

This is a first version to ask for help - as I'm not able to setup a windows failover cluster.

The file `MyAzureLab.ps1` has some functions the help to keep the script `create_Cluster.ps1` readable.

The cluster test always complains about:

`WARNING: Storage - Validate SCSI-3 Persistent Reservation: The test reported failure..`
