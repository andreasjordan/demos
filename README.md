# This is my demo space

This is mainly for demos with Microsoft SQL Server. And very much work in progress at this time.


## Setup a lab environment for demos

You find instructions and scripts to setup labs in the folder PSAutoLab, because I use this PowerShell module.


## Setup Always On with dbatools

In the folder AlwaysOn you find scripts to setup a cluster, default instances and Always On Availability Groups with the PowerShell module [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/).  
In the folder AlwaysOn_MultiInstance the demo is extended to use named instances with various SQL Server versions.
 

## Output results of sp_Blitz in Markdown format

In the folder sp_Blitz_markdown you find a script that converts the results of sp_Blitz in a bulleted list in Markdown format.
