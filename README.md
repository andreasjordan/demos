# This is my demo space

This is mainly for demos with Microsoft SQL Server and PowerShell. And very much work in progress all the time.


## Setup a lab environment for demos

I switched from PSAutoLab to AutomatedLab end of 2022, so you now find my scripts and resources to setup my lab in the AutomatedLab folder. Keep in mind that this is a modified copy of a private repository, so some things might not work without further modification. All information and scripts are intended as inspiration for own developments.


## Setup Always On with dbatools

In the folder AlwaysOn you find scripts to setup a cluster, default instances and Always On Availability Groups with the PowerShell module [dbatools](https://dbatools.io/).  
In the folder AlwaysOn_MultiInstance the demo is extended to use named instances with various SQL Server versions.
 

## Output results of sp_Blitz in Markdown format

In the folder sp_Blitz_markdown you find a script that converts the results of sp_Blitz in a bulleted list in Markdown format.
