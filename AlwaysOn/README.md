# Automated test for Always On Availability Groups

I use these scripts to have a repeatable test for the dbatools commands related to Always On Availability Groups.

I use [this](../AutomatedLab/CustomScripts/SQLServer_AlwaysOn.ps1) lab to run the scripts.

I have tested the scripts with the current 2.0 branch of dbatools.
